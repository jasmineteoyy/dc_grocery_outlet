**Grocery Outlet Problem Statement**

Objective: Match unlabeled grocery product images to unlabeled text descriptions using computer vision and natural language understanding methods.

Problem: Grocery Outletâ€™s products are often supplied from new brands or sources, resulting in unknown information about the product name, brand, and physical characteristics of the product. Given a set of product images, we will design, build, and evaluate a computer vision model that extracts the product information (brand, product name, size, measure). Additionally, since the products are often new, their descriptions frequently do not match the image. Grocery Outlet would like to automate the process of assigning matching product descriptions using natural language understanding methods to reduce the workload for staff. If time permits, additional models to identify the size, measure, or other physical attributes from the images will be explored.
